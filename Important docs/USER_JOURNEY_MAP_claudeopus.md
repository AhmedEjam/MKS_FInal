# MKS Android App — User Journey & UI Map

> **Last updated:** 2026-07-10. Room v30, 29 migration steps, 24 navigation routes.
>
> **What this is:** A plain-language, screen-by-screen map of every page, button, gesture, dialog, and interactable element in the MKS Android app. For each item, it says what happens when you interact with it — where it takes you, what it loads, and what it outputs.
>
> **How to use it:** Walk through each screen heading. Under each one you'll find every button and control listed with a short "what it does" description. This is meant to be updated whenever the app changes, and can be used side-by-side with an iOS project to check feature parity.
